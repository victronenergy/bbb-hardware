# venus-hardware

This repo contains schematics and other files relating to the hardware of
the [Venus GX](https://www.victronenergy.com/panel-systems-remote-monitoring/venus-gx).

See the [bbb ve-cape revisions](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/bbb-ve-cape-revisions)
page in the venus wiki for the change log.

Read [the project bbb page](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/project-bbb)
to find out what we are doing with the Beaglebone Black and Beaglebone Enhanced.

### Beaglebone vs BBB vs BBE vs BBG naming

Note that we started the project using BBB as a name for lots of things. But
that is a bit confusing, since there is really a whole family of more or less
compatible boards:

- BeagleBone Black
- BeagleBone Enhanced: this is the one we'll use in our product. See
the [SanCloudLtd/BeagleBoneEnhanced](https://github.com/SanCloudLtd/BeagleBoneEnhanced)
for the bbe schematic.
- BeagleBone Green
